# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: December 11, 2019 - Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: I learned pandas and taking course about different machine learning algorithms in Kaggle.

**Thoughts** I feel pretty good about myself. I think I learned a lot today. Going to do this for 99 more days at least.
