# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: December 11, 2019 - Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: I learned pandas and taking course about different machine learning algorithms in Kaggle.

**Thoughts** I feel pretty good about myself. I think I learned a lot today. Going to do this for 99 more days at least.

### Day 2: December 12, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: I continued the intermediate machine learning course in Kaggle and also researched about different parameters in scikit tools.

**Thoughts** Today was little bit more exhausting than yesterday. This took time. Still got to finish 3 more lessons, which I might complete by tomorrow. 


### Day 2: December 13, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: I completed the intermediate machine learning course in Kaggle and took part in the competition.

**Thoughts** Oh boy, learning was way smoother than applying this in the competition. I am stuck for now. I have already done for 4 hours straight, I didn't even know that. Now time for rest and I'll continue this tomorrow.
